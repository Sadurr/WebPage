    The Beatles have sold more records than any other musical artist in history, with EMI Records estimating more than one billion albums sold worldwide. The song "Yesterday" alone has been covered more than 3,000 times. They also hold the record for most #1 singles in the U.S. with twenty.  
  </p>

  <p>
    The story of The Beatles begins innocently enough when John Lennon got some friends together to form a Skiffle band called The Quarrymen. Skiffle was a popular early version of Rock & Roll, which was simple to play, needing just a guitar, a snare drum, a bass and two or three chords. The Quarrymen had a chronically unstable lineup, but Lennon was eventually joined by two younger musicians who shared his ambition: Paul McCartney, who was introduced to Lennon through a mutual friend in July 1957; and George Harrison, a schoolfriend of McCartney, who joined in the spring of 1958.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1959-60, the band gradually abandoned the Quarrymen name, performing under different names before settling with The Beatles. By this point, Stuart Sutcliffe had joined the band on bass, and Pete Best became their permanent drummer in August 1960. Performing in Liverpool and Hamburg, the Beatles became known for their raucous shows, which were a mix of covers and original tunes.
  </p>

  <p>
    During a residency in Hamburg, Stuart Sutcliffe fell in love with a German girl and decided to stay when the band returned to England, reducing the quintet to four members. Sutcliffe would suffer a brain hemorrhage on April 10, 1962 and die at the age of 21.
  </p>

  <p>
    Meanwhile, The Beatles' endless touring had won them over a number of fans, and they had gotten a big break by performing as a backup group for popular singer Tony Sheridan. Labeled as Tony Sheridan and the Beat Brothers, later released as The Beatles With Tony Sheridan, the single "My Bonnie" gained some popularity, particularly in Liverpool. Brian Epstein managed a large record shop in the city, and when he discovered that these Beat Brothers were a local group, he decided to go see them play. He was astonished at the reaction of the kids in the crowd and saw something special. He immediately signed on as their manager, made them change their style from a leather-jacket wearing gang to wearing matching suits while on stage, and, eventually, convinced them to drop Best as their drummer, and take on the drummer from another Liverpool band, Rory Storm & The Hurricanes, namely Richard Starkey, who used the stage name Ringo Starr.
  </p>

  <p>
    After numerous attempts by Epstein to get The Beatles a recording contract, they were eventually signed by Parlophone and recorded their first album Please Please Me (minus their first two singles which were already recorded) in a single day, so the raw energy of their stage show could show through. They had previously released two moderately successful singles, and the album was a hit in the U.K. Meanwhile, they had a lot of trouble getting signed to a label in the U.S., and eventually a version would be released on the tiny Vee-Jay Records label. In April, 1964, however, they managed to get booked on The Ed Sullivan Show, and through some clever marketing by Epstein, and a huge boost by New York deejay Murray the K, their appearance was a smash. By now, they had been picked up by the much larger Capitol Records.
  </p>

  <p>
    The early Beatles albums were released separately in the U.K. and the U.S. The U.K. versions invariably contained 14 songs, while the U.S. versions would contain 12. In addition, they would release numerous singles which would not appear on any U.K. album, but which would be packaged with the songs which were unreleased in the U.S., thus guaranteeing extra album sales in the U.S. With the advent of the CD, this difference would be rectified by making the U.K. versions the standard albums, and the addition of two singles and rarities compilations, Past Masters: Volume One and Past Masters: Volume Two, would make the collection complete.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Beatles would simply pour out albums from 1963-1966. In those three years they would release six U.K. albums. They would also star in two movies during this time period, A Hard Day's Night (with a title inspired by a Ringo quote) and Help! Both spawned incredibly successful soundtrack albums. The earlier albums included a large split between Lennon/McCartney originals, covers and the occasional Harrison composition. As time wore on, there was less reliance on covers. Lennon and McCartney would write the bulk of the songs, with Harrison usually getting a couple of compositions in per album. Starr would write only two songs through the groupâ€™s history, although he was usually given a Lennon/McCartney song to sing on each album. As time wore on, although the Lennon/McCartney songwriting tag would always remain, the two would write together less and less often.  
  </p>

  <p>
    In 1967 The Beatles would release only one full album, but it is considered by many to be the seminal album of the rock era. Inspired by The Beach Boys' album Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band would break new ground for the band, with music and lyrics inspired less by teenage crushes, and more by a desire to create art out of sound and by their heavy use of hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD. Songs like "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds" and "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite", were swirling sound collages, and were pretty much unplayable outside of a recording studio, so The Beatles gave up on touring by this point. The members, once so close as to regularly share a bedroom, were growing apart, both artistically and as friends.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not long after the release of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Epstein was found dead of an overdose of sleeping pills. All four of The Beatles were at a meeting of the International Meditation Society in Bangor, North Wales at the time, pursuing their interest in Eastern mysticism. This fascination came primarily from George, and the following year the whole band joined him at a retreat in India with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, an Indian mystic who had founded a movement known as Transcendental Meditation.
  </p>

  <p>
    Paul was taken by an idea to create what was basically a traveling circus on a bus and to film the entire trip. Out of this trip would come The Magical Mystery Tour; a TV movie and several new songs which would be released as a double EP in the U.K. The film was a critical disaster, and it served to push the members further apart. When they came back together to record The Beatles, better known as The White Album, the band had come to a breaking point. Paul was a perfectionist, and on a number of his songs, he performed all the instruments. Ringo briefly quit the band during the recording sessions. The album, a sprawling double disc, clearly showed that these were four people going in different directions. The White Album would be released on their new label, Apple Records.
